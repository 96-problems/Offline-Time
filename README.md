# Offline-Time
We decided to make Offline Time after reading Jonathan Franzen's quote, “What you have to do… is you plug in an Ethernet cable with superglue, and then you saw off the little head of it.” In referencing how he stays productive and in the zone when writing.

Offline Time is a small app we made as a companion app to our upcoming writing app to help us stay focused like Franzen. How it works is:

1. You set a timer for how long you want to be offline and press start.
2. It switches off your WiFi
3. If you try to stop the timer it takes 5 times reopening the window and putting up with passive-aggressive messages
4. When you finish your offline time it congratulates you and offers you a chance to brag

It was just a small #1DayHack by our team, so it's not the most complete or perfect app, but it is all on Github for you to help perfect if you feel so inclined!

p.s. You can read more about why we made this in our Medium series in the lead up to NaNoWriMo https://medium.com/30daysofwriting-prep/15-go-offline-like-franzen-58ed459690ce#.ku5exv58g
